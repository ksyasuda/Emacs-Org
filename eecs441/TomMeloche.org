* Bethany
** going to the candle dipping place, not the orchard
*** three vats of vats that can melt the wax
*** sell little white stub on a whick
**** buy for 2 dollars
*** only problem was there were so many kids crammed around the whole day that she was selling too many
**** couldn't cram 2 more dollars into the box to store money
*** buy the stub and can get red, green, blue wax
**** dip in water after the wax
**** each dip makes it a little thicker
**** kids are crazy
*** often there is a Billy there
**** dipping candle for half an hour
**** pulls out big grey candle with mom sitting outside
***** mom says its the best candle of all time
***** keep dipping she says while shes sitting outside
*** daughter made dad do some candles as well
**** daughter usually did 4 or 5
*** usually some adults who were art students
**** she real good at candle dipping
**** no idea how she made that candle with what is available
***** I would make a Billy candle if I tried to make her candle
*** also had put put and apple cider
**** really went for the candle dipping
***** called the candle dipping place
* motivation for mom
** she's getting a break, while the kid is doing something 'positive'
*** worth $2 for her since she is going to get a lot of relaxation time
* Billy
** wants to make the biggest, best candle
** competitive dude
* art student
** likes arts, crafts, painting
** motivation for being there: school art project
*** more likely its instagram motivation
* week after one of the candle dipping events
** went to a different place
** went to see astronaut Sally Ride at UMICH
*** was doing something special 12-14 to encourage to go into stem
** people from the college will be there as well to talk about the future
** tons of people there, when got to norh campus,
*** saw all of the tables set up outside
*** tons of information about the schools, projects, and stuff
*** with bethany he looks at the first table and talk to the students there and then go to the next one
**** keep going down the line, across the dude probably
*** far side of the north campus quad, table that was surrounded by a mob of kids
* behind every single persona, you have to continue observing the world and pull from the whole life experience to add to personas
* crowd of kids is a free ad for the candle place
** kids want to go to where the crowds are
* go back to the orchard one year and there was a rule change
** new rule: can only dip candle three times in each color
** knew bethany wouldn't read but he didn't tell
** person at the stand notices after about 15 dips
** tries to argue the fine details of the rules
* writing an ad is predicting the future based on personas
* if they did personas well could they have done better as a park
** probably
