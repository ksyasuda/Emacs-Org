* Kyle Yasuda, senior computer science, graduate in april this year
* I'm a big believer in the best way to learn is by doing
** which is why I've been working hard over the past year to improve my tech skills 
* In the past, before each Summer, I set one big goal (among other smaller goals) that I want to accomplish before the start of the new school year
** two years ago that was learning p5.js, which is a client-side JavaScript library for creating 2D and 3D graphics and animations
** I mostly used it to build an implementations of games such as Flappy Bird and Chess
* Last year though, with the covid pandemic and the insuing lockdowns it spurred, I found myself with much more time than I had anticipated
** My original goal was to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually React.js to build a blog
** But I was able to accomplish so much more
** I rebuilt my blog twice 
*** the frist time was after I found Gatsby.js, which is a React Framework that has GraphQL built-in along with other useful features and a large number of plugins
**** brought all my lighthouse scores to 94 and above
**** also converted the blog to a progressive web app
*** the second time was converting my website to TypeScript
** I also learned how to use backend frameworks in both Python and Node.js
*** Where I've worked with SQLite3, and PostgreSQL databases
*** in RESTful APIs
** While I was working on all that, I installed Arch Linux on my old laptop and began learning how to use, maintain, and customize it
*** There are many reasons I wanted to learn how to use Linux
**** Some of them quickly: it's open source, it (especially Arch Linux) is highly customizable and automatable, and even though Windows (the OS I used before) has WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) I became fed up with the speed, memory usage, and the general limitations it has compared to native Linux
*** I now have a flavor of Arch Linux installed as my operating system on my main laptop as well as my desktop PC and beleive that my productivity has gone up as a result
**** I've become very good at using the terminal 
**** Learned bash/Python scripting
**** I installed tiling window manager, i3
***** along with vim and git have greatly increased my productivity as a developer
* Now with almost a year in retrospect, I realize that really enjoy learning and building things
** I imagine the curiosity and excitement I get when starting a new project is similar to that of a kid in front of a kid in front of a box of legos or an author while fleshing out a story. 
* And The classes I've chosen to take this year reflect that relization
** All the classes I've taken or am enrolled in this year have included building User-Interfaces, mobile apps, or games as a major part of the cirriculum
*** Additionally the projects in these classes are team-based, where I've been working on improving and gaining experience working in teams
* Admittedly I have not done as much testing as I would have liked, and that is something that I have been working on for the past month and a half
** I've been learning how to use jest and enzyme for React applications as well as started messing around with cypress.io recently
* I'm looking to continue learning and developing my skills after graduation and think that I would be a great fit for this Frontend engineering position.
