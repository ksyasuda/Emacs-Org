#+TITLE: Naive Bayesian Bn

* Naive Bayesian Network
** from the initial statstics
*** get the frequency table
*** get the liklihood table
** Ex

*** A: Without Bayesian Theorem.  Without using Bayesian Theorem, we can directly calculate these probs
**** P(play|sunny) = 3/(2+3) = .6, P(-play|sunny) = .4
*** With Bayesian Theorem:
**** P(play|sunny) is proportional to P(sunny|play) * P(play) = 3/9 * 9/14 = 3/14
**** P(-play|sunny) proportional to P(sunny|-play) * P(play) = 2/5 * 5/14 = 2/14 -> play
*** B: Classify P(c|play)
**** P(Overcast|play) is prop to P(play|Overcast) * P(Overcast) = 1 * .29 = .29
**** P(Rainy|play): P(play|Rainy) * P(Rainy) = .4 * .36 = .14
**** P(Sunny|play): P(play|sunny) * P(Sunny) = .6 * .36 = .22 -> overcast
* Bayesian Network
** A node (X) is conditionally independent of its non-descendents given its parents
** Node X is conditionally independent of all other nodes given its Markov blanked
*** parents, children, and parents of the children
** Example

*** P(s) = .7
*** P(n) = .5
*** basedon the structure of this network and the definition of a Bayesian Network, write down the formula P(s, n, e, r, w)
*** P(s, n, e, r, w) = P(s) * P(n) * P(e|s, n) * P(r|e) * P(w|e,n)
*** calculate the following:
**** P(r|n)
***** R and N are not directly connected
***** P(r|n) = P(e|n) * P(r|e) + P(-e|n) * P(r|-e)
****** marginalize over E
****** left side of equation is where e is true
****** right side of equation is where e is false
***** don't have the probability for e|n and -e|n
****** can be derived from the table
***** P(e|n) = P(e|n,s) * P(s) + P(e|n,-s) * P(-s)
****** .9 * .7 + .5 * .3 = .78
**** P(w|n,s)
***** P(w|n,s) = P(w,n,s)/P(n/s)
***** P(w,n,s) = P(s) * P(n) * P(E|s,n) * P(w|E,n)
***** P(w|n,s) = P(E|s,n) * P(w|e,n) + P(-e|s,n) * P(w|-e,n)
****** = .9 * .9 + .1 *.3 .84
