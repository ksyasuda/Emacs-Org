* patterns in non-software design
** high level advice
*** consider code change as a certainty
**** redesign is expensive
*** consider your requirements and their changes
**** use patterns that fit your current or anticipated needs
*** consider multiple designs
* Structural patterns
** ease design by identifying simple ways to realize relationships among entities
** adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that converts the interface of a class into another interface client expects
* Adapter examples
** implementing a stack interface using a LinkedList interface
* composite design pattern
** allows clients to treat individual objects and groups of objects uniformly
* proxy design pattern
** provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it
* creational design patterns
** avoid complexity by controlling object creation so that objects are created in a manner suitable for the situation
** make system independent of how its objects are created
** plain ctor may not allow you to
*** control how and when objects are used
*** overcome language limitations
**** eg no default arguments
*** hide polymorphic traits
** Named constructor idiom
*** you declare the class's normal constructors to be private or protected and make a public static creation method
* Factory pattern variant
** creational design pattern that uses a factory methods to create objects without having the return type reveal the exact subclass
** variants
*** may encounter implementations in which special methods create the right type
* abstract factory design pattern
** encapsulates a group of factories that hav a common theme without specifying their concrete class
* Singleton design pattern
** restricts the instantiation of a class to exactly one logical instance
** ensures that a class has only one logical instance at runtime and provides a global point of access to it
* should only use singleton pattern when current or future requirements dictate that only one instance should exist
** singleton is not a lisense to make everything global
* observer pattern allows dependent object to notified automatically
** basically youtube subscribing
* template method desing pattern
** behavioral desing pattern involves a method in a superclass that operates in terms of high-level steps that are implemented by abstract helper methods
** provided by concrete implementations
** define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation
** deferring some steps to subclass
** lets subclasses redefine certain steps of that alg without chanign the algorithm's structure
