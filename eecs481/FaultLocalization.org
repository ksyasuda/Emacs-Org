* Modern software is huge
* Humans are poor at comprehending large scales
* Fault localization is the task of identifying source code regions implicated in a bug
** regresssion test is failing, which lines should we change to fix it
** answer is not unique: there are often many places to fix a bug
** debugging includes fault localization
** answer may take the form of a list ranked by sus
* Debuggers
** can operate on source code or assembly code
** inspect values of registers, memory
** key features
*** attach to process
*** single-stepping
*** breakpoints
*** conditional breakpoints
*** watchpoints
* Signals
** a signal is an asynchronous notification sent to a process about an event
*** Ctrl+C
*** exceptions (divide by zero, null ptr)
*** from the OS (SIGPIPE)
** can install a signal handler - a procedure that will be executed when the signal occurs
*** signal handlers are vulnerable to race conditions
* Attaching a Debugger
** requires operating system support
** special system call that allows one process to act as a debugger for a target
*** what are security concerns
** once this is done, debugger can basically "catch signals" delivered to the target
