#+TITLE: Unknown Types

#+begin_src js

let userInput: unknown;
// unknown because we don't know lol
let userName: string;

// allowed
userInput = 5;
userInput = 'Max';

// error
// userName needs a string but userInput can be any value
// using any would work here because any always works
userName = userInput;
// unknown makes sure you can't do everything but still have some of the benefits of TypeScript
#+end_src
