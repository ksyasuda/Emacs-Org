#+TITLE: Constructor

* Not even for constructors but
** class methods can be given a `this` argument, along with the type, that will bind the function to an instance of the type
#+begin_src javascript

class Department {
    name: string;

    constructor(n: string) {
        this.name = n;
    }

    describe(this: Department) {
        console.log('Department: ' + this.name)
    }
}

// no error because the describe method is called on the accounting object, which is of type Department
const accounting = new Department('Accounting');
accounting.describe();

// will throw error in TypeScript since accountingCopy is an Object type, not Department
const accountingCopy = { describe: accounting.describe };
accountingCopy.describe();

// no error because the Object hass all the properties that are expected from the Department type
const accountingCopy2 = { name: 'Nice', describe: accounting.describe };
accountingCopy2.describe();
