* Infrastructure as a service: rent a computer in someone else's datacenter
**  benefits
** * physical datacenter handled by someone else
** * backups and failover handled by someone else
** * instantly and automatically rent more computers
**  examples
** aws ec2, google compute engine, azure vms
* IaaS to PaaS
** problem: managing software on many rented computers is a pain
** solution: rent computers with the software already installed
** PaaS: rent computer in someone else's data center
** examples: servers with database already installed
* Software as a Service: rent a web app build, hosted, and maintained by somebody else
** zero effort
** ex
*** ms office, dropbox, github, gmail
* how do I run web app in the cloud
** scale one thing at a time
** static pages, server-side dynamic pages, client-side dynamic pages, etc.
* Static pages
** a request returns a copy of a file
** how do we server copies to many clients at a the same time
*** many servers
** long time for request/res to traverse global internet
*** servers in different geographic locations
* IP
** every computer has an address
** when client makes request, goes to router -> router -> intened destination
*** more hops = more time
*** request/response takes longer
* DNS
** direct clients to the IP address of nearby server using DNS
** translates ips to names 
** continuously updated by many parties
** when browswer makes request for a webpage
*** goes to nameserver -> returns ip address
*** use ip to connect to server
** namespace
*** names must be unique
*** tree structure 1-63 chars per node
*** each node is usually a server running DNS server software
*** grouped into administrative zones
*** can be primary or secondary servers
**** secondary pulls data from primary servers
** Ip address are commonly assigned automatically
** DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protcol
** root nameservers
*** responsible for locating the top level domain name servers
*** 13 total in the world
** Administration
*** IANA oversees global IP allocation
** DNS as a security vulnerability
*** DNS cache poisoning
**** direct requests to twitter.com to the wrong IP address
*** remedies
**** use HTTPS/SSL/TSL, problem mitigated
**** DNSSEC is a security extension to DNS
* CDN
** Content Delivery Network
** stores static files at many locations throughtout the world and serves nearby clients
** STATIC FILES: HTML, images, videos
** Akami
*** first content-delivery
**** step 1: places servers across the country
**** step 2: gets client data
***** especially images, videos
**** step 3: copies to all ndoes in network
***** each server gets a copy of everything
***** specialized DNS servers resolve name to nearby servers
***** resolution strongly dependent on location of client, network conditions
*** CDN outages = website down
** copies of static content
